# AI Virtual Mouse using Hand Gesture Recognition

This project uses computer vision and hand gesture recognition to control the mouse pointer without any physical device. 
Using a standard webcam, it detects hand landmarks and allows users to:

- Move the mouse cursor by moving the index finger
- Perform left-click by pinching the thumb and index finger
- Perform right-click with another gesture
- Double-click through a separate gesture
- Take screenshots with a special hand gesture

Built with OpenCV, MediaPipe, PyAutoGUI, and Pynput, this AI Virtual Mouse showcases the power of real-time hand tracking and gesture-based computer control.

## Technologies Used
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- PyAutoGUI
- Pynput
- Python 3.x
